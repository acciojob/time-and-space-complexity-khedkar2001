    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
   <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. A more efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, making it faster and more scalable.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is commonly expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to represent the worst-case memory usage.</p>
